# Task-2-DATA-ANALYST
Dashboard using powerbi
This dashboard was created using Microsoft Excel to understand sales data.

It shows:

- Total sales and total quantity sold
- Sales by region and sub-region
- Sales for each product category and segment
- Monthly and yearly sales trends

The dashboard helps to see where sales are high or low, which categories are performing well, and how sales change over time.
